# Google Translate Beatbox Helper
In the German Google Translate is a little easter egg, a beatbox.
There are a few commands for this and this extension helps you use them by adding a few buttons right into the Google Translate interface.

## Installation
Because this extension is not (yet) at the Google Chrome Web Store, you have to install it manually.
There are two ways to do this:

* Download the compiled `.crx` file and drag it into Chrome.
* Download the whole repository, go to Google Chrome > `Tools` > `Extensions` > `Developer Mode` > `Load unpacked extension...` and select the directory you have downloaded.

### Autoupdate
Because this extension is not yet at the Google Chrome Web Store, there will be no autoupdate and you will have to install updates manually.

## Usage
To use this extension, go to `http://translate.google.com` (it will only work on `google.com` and `google.de`!) and you will see the beatbox notes.
Click on the buttons and the codes will be automatically inserted into the source field.
The beatbox is only available if you

* have German selected as either 'from' or 'to' language
* only use the the displayed codes, if you use other codes or text, it wonÂ´t work
